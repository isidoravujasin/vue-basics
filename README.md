# Vue Basics – Mini Blog

This is a small Vue 3 project I built to get familiar with Vue fundamentals before starting a larger Nuxt task.

The goal of this project was to practice basic concepts like routing, data fetching and component structure.

## What the app does
- Fetches posts from the JSONPlaceholder API
- Displays a list of posts
- Shows post details on a separate page
- Uses a simple centralized API service
- Handles basic loading and error states

## Tech stack
- Vue 3
- Vue Router
- Vite

## Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
